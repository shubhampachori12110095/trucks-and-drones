Welcome to RL-TSP-VRP-D's documentation!
========================================

This documentation provides an explanation for the code in collaboration with the bachelor thesis: `Using Reinforcement Learning to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drones <https://www.stackoverflow.com>`_ and the research project `Using Reinforcement Learning to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones <https://www.stackoverflow.com>`_. Further details can be read here: :ref:`About the project <about_project>` (Abbrevations you may find in the documentaion and code are listed here too). 


Information about the installation, first steps and a general example are found in the :ref:`Getting Started Guide <getting_started>`.
