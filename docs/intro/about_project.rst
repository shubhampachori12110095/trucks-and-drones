About the project
=================

Leveling the electricity consumption of an industrial plant is relevant in the industry with regard to the possibility of reducing electricity costs. The cost-factor electricity consists of two parts: One part depends on the amount consumed and cannot be influenced without reducing the production or exchanging the machines. The second part depends on the maximum capacity used per year. This part can be reduced by capping power peaks. With the increasing share of renewable energies and the elimination of constant electricity generators, the topic is becoming more and more relevant on the generator side too. The share of renewable energies can only be increased further if energy storages are used on the side of the producers and consumers. This will prevent the grid to be be loaded irregularly and unexpectedly, thus saving grid fees [Fuch12].

In order to smooth the power consumption of a production system, the energy demand must be adjusted or an energy storage device must be used. In order to adapt the energy demand, the production itself would have to be changed and this would severely limit the work processes. In this thesis, therefore, the possibility of using an energy storage device is considered to shift power peaks into periods with lower power requirements. The main focus of the work should be on the investigation of the extent to which machine learning can be used for this possibility: An LSTM is used to make predictions about future consumption and, based on this, reinforcement learning agents, with different approaches, decide when to charge and discharge. Then it is checked whether an RL agent can achieve a better result than a conventional heuristic and whether such a solution is a suitable solution for this type of problem.
